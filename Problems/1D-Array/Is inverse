Input :- Integer representing N
         Integer representing N numbers.
Process :- Write a function which returns true if the second array is inverse of first and false otherwise. Print the value returned.
Output :- Print the boolean output.

Constraints :- N cannot be Negative.
               0 <= N <= 10^9
              -10^9 <= Arr[i] <= 10^9


Example(To be used only for expected output):
              Input:
              4
              1 2 3 0
