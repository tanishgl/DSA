There is a collection of rocks where each rock has various minerals embeded in it. Each type of mineral is designated by a lowercase letter in the range ascii[a-z]. 
There may be multiple occurrences of a mineral in a rock. A mineral is called a gemstone if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks in the collection.
Given a list of minerals embedded in each of the rocks, display the number of types of gemstones in the collection.

Input :- integer n (no. of rocks), followed by n lines containing a string arr[i] where each letter represents an occurence of a mineral in the current rock.
Output :- Print the number of gemstones.

Example :- 

        Input :- ['abc','abc','bc'];
        Output :- 2
        Brief :- In above 3 rocks, Mineral 'a' occurs in only 2 rocks whereas Mineral 'b' and 'c' occur in all rocks. Hence, 2 gemstones 'b' and 'c'.
