Input :- (i) N*M matrix. N = No. of rows, M = No. of columns
         (ii) An integer s which means the ring number.
         (iii) An integer r which means the number of rotations in anti-clockwise direction.
         
Process :- Think of the matrix as a set of concentric circles, going from outer circle (starting from (0,0)) to inside. 
           Illustration :-
           
                            a b c d e f g
                            h i j k l m n
                            o p q r s t u 
                            v w x y z A F
           
          First Ring :-     a -> h -> o -> v -> w -> x -> y -> z -> A -> F -> u -> n -> g -> f -> e -> d -> c -> b 
          Second Ring :-    i -> p -> q -> q -> r -> s -> t -> m -> l -> k -> j
          
          You have to rotate the s'th ring by r times in anti-clockwise direction.
 
 Output :- Print the resultant matrix.
 
 Constraints :- NA
 
 Note :- Above illustration is just for understanding purpose. In the solution, it is assumed that the matrix consists of only integer data type.
