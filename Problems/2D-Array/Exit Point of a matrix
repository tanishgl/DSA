Input :-  1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
          2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.
          3. You are given n*m numbers (1's and 0's), representing elements of 2d array a.
Process :-  Consider this array a maze and a player enters from top-left corner in east direction.
            The player moves in the same direction as long as he meets '0'. On seeing a 1, he takes a 90 deg right turn.
            You are required to print the indices in (row, col) format of the point from where you exit the matrix.
Output :- Print the exit point of the matrix.

Example :-

            Input :- 
                  4
                  4
                  0 0 1 0 
                  1 0 0 0
                  0 0 0 0
                  1 0 1 0 

             Output:-

                  1
                  3
                  
             Illustration :-
             
       START ->   0 -> 0 -> 1    0 
                            |
                            v
                  1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> EXIT POINT REACHED WE ARE OUT OF MATRIX. EXIT POINT :- (1,3)
                  ^         |
                  |         v
                  0    0    0    0
                  ^         |
                  |         v
                  1 <- 0 <- 1    0 
                            
       
      In above illustration We start from (0,0) and go as per instructions. At each '1', we turn 90 degrees. At each '0', we continue moving in the same direction.
