Input :-  1. You are given a number n1, representing the number of rows of 1st matrix.
          2. You are given a number m1, representing the number of columns of 1st matrix.
          3. You are given n1*m1 numbers, representing elements of 2d array a1.
          4. You are given a number n2, representing the number of rows of 2nd matrix.
          5. You are given a number m2, representing the number of columns of 2nd matrix.
          6. You are given n2*m2 numbers, representing elements of 2d array a2.
Process :- 1. If the two arrays representing two matrices of dimensions n1 * m1 and n2 * m2 can be multiplied, display the contents of prd array as specified in output Format.
           2. If the two arrays can't be multiplied, print "Invalid input".
Output :- Print the respective answer.

Example :- 
          
           Input :-
                  2
